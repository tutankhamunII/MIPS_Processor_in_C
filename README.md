# MIPS_Processor_in_C
This project implements a full MIPS processor in C in the terminal. The program basically reads binary files generator by GCC Compiler and save individual instruction in its memory. 
It this fetch >> decode >> compute >> write back >> and access memory, which is the five pipeline stages of a MIPS processor. The final result of executing one instruction is shown by printing the 
values of all the processor registers. The project was tested using multiple binary files and the final register values were compared against final register values resulted from running the assembly
version of the binary files in MARS MIPS simulator. The program based all test cases as shown in the screenshots zip folder.
